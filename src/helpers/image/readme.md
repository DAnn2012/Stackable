# Image Helper

This helps out in using images via the Image Component in blocks in v3.

* `attributes.js` - provides the attributes for when registering blocks that use this
* `style.js` - adds the necessary styles for editing and saving the block
* `use-image.js` - creates the change handlers to be used by the Component
* `index.js` - creates image props to be used by the Component
